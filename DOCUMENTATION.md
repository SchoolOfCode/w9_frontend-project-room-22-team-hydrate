# Bootcamp Booster

This week-long team project was centred on the brief of identifying a problem faced by bootcampers and creating a solution for this.

Bootcamp Booster is our solution for providing curated resources to bootcampers wanting to further their studies, to cut-down the amount of time spent searching and sifting through search results to find appropriate and helpful information.

## Lessons Learned

While making this project we faced a number of challenges, not least of all meeting as a new team, identifying what we wanted to make as a project, and completing our MVP within a week - as well as preparing and delivering a presentation to industry experts!

While building the project we had to research how to create new pages, and then learn and implement React Router within a very short window of time.

We also had never linked a React frontend with an Express backend, so this was something else we had to learn - and crucial to the functionality of the entire application.
